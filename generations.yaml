generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Mk1)"
    start_year: 1974
    end_year: 1983
    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Golf (known as the Rabbit in North America) replaced the iconic Beetle as Volkswagen's core model. Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, it pioneered the modern hatchback configuration with front-wheel drive, a transverse engine layout, and fold-down rear seats. Initially offered with 1.1L and 1.5L gasoline engines and later a 1.5L diesel, it prioritized efficiency and practicality. The performance-oriented GTI variant, introduced in 1976 with a fuel-injected 1.6L engine producing 110 horsepower, essentially created the hot hatchback category. The first-generation Golf established a formula of practical, efficient transportation with engaging driving dynamics that would define the model for decades to come."

  - name: "Second Generation (Mk2)"
    start_year: 1984
    end_year: 1992
    description: "The second-generation Golf grew in size and sophistication while maintaining the fundamental principles of its predecessor. The exterior featured more rounded styling while preserving the recognizable Golf silhouette. Engineering improvements included increased body rigidity and more refined suspension, contributing to better ride and handling characteristics. Engine options expanded to include more powerful and efficient variants, including 16-valve versions in GTI models. This generation also saw the introduction of the Golf syncro with all-wheel drive and continued the performance tradition with the GTI G60 featuring a supercharged engine. The Mk2 successfully evolved the Golf formula with improved quality, comfort, and performance while maintaining the practical versatility that made the original so popular."

  - name: "Third Generation (Mk3)"
    start_year: 1993
    end_year: 1999
    description: "The third-generation Golf represented a significant advance in safety, refinement, and technology. The body structure incorporated enhanced crash protection, while the exterior design featured softer, more aerodynamic styling. This generation introduced the VR6 engine option, a compact narrow-angle V6 that delivered impressive performance in the range-topping models. Other innovations included the first TDI diesel Golf, utilizing direct injection turbo diesel technology for improved efficiency, and the first Golf Cabriolet based on the new platform. The Mk3 also saw the introduction of standard dual airbags, ABS brakes, and improved environmental considerations in manufacturing and recycling. Though sometimes considered less charismatic than its predecessors, the Mk3 represented an important evolution in making the Golf more sophisticated and safer."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (Mk4)"
    start_year: 1999
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The fourth-generation Golf set new standards for build quality and refinement in the compact class. The exterior featured clean, sophisticated styling with tight panel gaps and impressive attention to detail. The interior quality took a significant step forward with soft-touch materials, damped switches, and a solid feel previously associated with more expensive vehicles. Engine options ranged from basic petrol and diesel variants to the powerful VR6 and the new 1.8T turbocharged four-cylinder. This generation expanded the Golf portfolio further with the R32, featuring a 3.2L VR6 engine and 4MOTION all-wheel drive, establishing a new performance flagship above the GTI. Technological advances included the option of DSG dual-clutch transmission, electronic stability control, and improved safety features. The Mk4 successfully elevated the Golf's position in the market, bridging the gap between mainstream and premium compact cars."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (Mk5)"
    start_year: 2004
    end_year: 2008
    description: "The fifth-generation Golf returned to the model's sportier roots while maintaining the quality improvements of its predecessor. The exterior design was more dynamic and distinctive, while the chassis featured a sophisticated multilink rear suspension that improved both handling and ride comfort. The GTI variant regained its performance credibility with a 2.0L turbocharged direct-injection engine, while the R32 continued as the all-wheel drive flagship. This generation introduced adaptive chassis control, bi-xenon headlights, and improved infotainment options. The TDI diesel engines gained common-rail injection technology for better refinement and efficiency. The Mk5 successfully balanced driver engagement with practical considerations, reconnecting with enthusiasts while continuing to serve as versatile family transportation."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (Mk6)"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The sixth-generation Golf was more of an extensive redesign of the Mk5 rather than a completely new model. The exterior featured sharper styling with influences from other Volkswagen models like the Scirocco, while the interior quality and refinement were further improved with better materials and sound insulation. Engine choices continued to evolve with more efficient TSI petrol and TDI diesel options, including the introduction of BlueMotion technology focused on maximum efficiency. The GTI continued with an improved 2.0L turbocharged engine, while the range-topping variant changed from R32 to simply 'R', now powered by a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder rather than the VR6. Safety technology advanced with features like adaptive cruise control and park assist becoming available. Despite its relatively short production run, the Mk6 successfully refined the Golf formula with a focus on quality and efficiency."

  - name: "Seventh Generation (Mk7)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The seventh-generation Golf moved to Volkswagen's versatile MQB platform, enabling significant advances in technology, efficiency, and safety while reducing weight by up to 100 kg compared to its predecessor. The exterior design evolved subtly but incorporated sharper lines and more precise detailing. Engine options were thoroughly updated, with downsized turbocharged petrol and diesel engines focused on improved efficiency without sacrificing performance. This generation expanded the Golf family significantly with the introduction of the full-electric e-Golf, plug-in hybrid GTE, compressed natural gas TGI, and high-performance Golf R with up to 310 horsepower in later iterations. Technology features took a major step forward with available digital instrument clusters, advanced infotainment systems with gesture control, and expanded driver assistance systems including semi-autonomous capabilities. A facelift in 2017 (sometimes called Mk7.5) updated the styling and technology further. The Mk7 successfully modernized the Golf with class-leading technology and efficiency while maintaining its fundamental appeal."

  - name: "Eighth Generation (Mk8)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The eighth-generation Golf, introduced in late 2019 as a 2020 model, represents a digital revolution for Volkswagen's core model while maintaining evolutionary exterior styling. Built on an updated version of the MQB platform, the exterior features refined aerodynamics and a distinctive front end with standard LED lighting. The interior marks the most radical change, with almost all physical buttons replaced by touch-sensitive surfaces and screens, including a standard 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10-inch center touchscreen. Powertrain options include updated TSI petrol and TDI diesel engines, now featuring 48-volt mild hybrid technology on many variants, plus expanded plug-in hybrid offerings with increased electric range. The GTI continues as the core performance model, while the GTD (diesel) and GTE (plug-in hybrid) offer alternative performance flavors, and the Golf R remains the all-wheel drive flagship. Connected services and driver assistance systems are significantly expanded, with Car2X communication enabling the vehicle to exchange information with infrastructure and other vehicles. The Mk8 maintains the Golf's position as a technology leader in its segment, though the digital-focused interior has received mixed reception from traditional Golf enthusiasts."
